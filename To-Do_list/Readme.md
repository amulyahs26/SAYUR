To-Do List Application:
A simple, user-friendly To-Do List web application that allows users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete. 
The application uses localStorage for task persistence across browser sessions, and includes filter options to view all, active, or completed tasks.

Features:
Add Tasks: Create new tasks with a custom title.
Edit Tasks: Modify existing tasks by clicking on the task title.
Delete Tasks: Remove tasks from the list.
Mark as Complete: Toggle task completion status with a checkbox.
Persistent Storage: Tasks are saved in localStorage so they remain even after the browser is closed.
Filter Options: View all tasks or filter by active and completed status.

Technologies Used:
HTML: Structure of the application.
CSS: Basic styling and layout of the app, including a centered container and styled buttons.
JavaScript: Handles the application's logic, including CRUD operations, localStorage management, and filtering.
