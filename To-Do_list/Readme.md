# To-Do List Application

A simple, user-friendly To-Do List web application that allows users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete. The application uses `localStorage` for task persistence across browser sessions and includes filter options to view all, active, or completed tasks.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Create new tasks with a custom title.
- **Edit Tasks**: Modify existing tasks by clicking on the task title.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from the list.
- **Mark as Complete**: Toggle task completion status with a checkbox.
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are saved in `localStorage`, so they remain even after the browser is closed.
- **Filter Options**: View all tasks or filter by active and completed status.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the application.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout of the app, including a centered container and styled buttons.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for CRUD operations, `localStorage` management, and filtering.
