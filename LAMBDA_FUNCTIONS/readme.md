Lambda Functions in Python
Lambda functions are a type of anonymous function in Python, defined using the lambda keyword. Unlike regular functions created with def, lambda functions are single-line expressions that do not have a name and are used for simple operations
lambda arguments: expression
Arguments: Lambda functions can have any number of arguments, separated by commas.
Expression: A single expression whose result is returned. Lambda functions cannot contain complex statements or multiple expressions.
Characteristics of Lambda Functions
Anonymous: Lambda functions are unnamed, which means they are often used in situations where a function is needed temporarily.
Concise: Because they are limited to a single expression, lambda functions are concise and typically used for short, simple operations.
Common Use Cases:
Used as arguments to higher-order functions such as map(), filter(), and sorted().
Ideal for defining small callback functions in event-driven or functional programming.
Limitations
Single Expression Only: Lambda functions cannot contain multiple expressions or complex logic. For more comprehensive functions, def should be used.
Readability: While lambda functions are useful for simple tasks, using them for more complicated logic can make the code harder to read and understand.
Conclusion: Lambda functions are a powerful and concise way to write small, anonymous functions in Python, especially when used with higher-order functions. However, for more complex operations, using regular functions defined with def is preferred for clarity.
